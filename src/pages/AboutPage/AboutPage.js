                Everybody seems so young. And everybody’s talking 
                about restaurants. If there are scholars who hope 
                to study how a vibrant food culture can help radically 
                transform an American city, the time to do that is right 
                now, in real time, in the place that gave us Heinz ketchup… 
                No one can pinpoint whether it was the artists or techies 
                or chefs who got the revitalization rolling.

                I keep seeing versions of the same story about Pittsburgh’s changing restaurant 
                and sustainable agriculture scene: young, recent transplants 
                to Pittsburgh with tech money and a love of the arts are innovating food 
                in a city that subsisted only on meat, potatoes and ketchup for decades. 
                Taking a drive down Penn Avenue, I can see the uneven benefits of Pittsburgh’s 
                tech boom/arts renaissance/food revolution. Affordable housing options are dwindling, 
                but Whole Foods needs more space.

                (free snacks) is a public history project that documents and celebrates the differences in taste, 
                identity and memory among the city’s residents.  Everybody eats–not just foodies, techies and artists.  
                The narrative of a changing city and its foodscape should include the experiences of all residents. 
                This project is a step towards a more democratic version of Pittsburgh’s story. The thoughts and memories 
                of the 77 narrators included in this project only tap the surface of the range and complexity of voices 
                in the city. Excerpts of these video conversations will be screened at The Livermore on Wednesday, 
                August 31 alongside prints by Madalyn Hochendoner and designs by Stephanie Hall. Transcripts of all 
                (free snacks) conversations are archived on this website.

                The <a href="http://falk.chatham.edu/mafs/">Master of Arts in Food Studies</a> program at Chatham University provides 
                a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to food systems, from production to consumption, focusing on issues of sustainability, systems, 
                and equity.  Graduates acquire experiential and intellectual knowledge in agriculture, food cultures, 
                cuisines, cultural representation, and myriad other skills to help them address the challenges of the 
                contemporary landscape of food and agriculture.  From meat production to media literacy, from pest management 
                to global coffee production, the program engages in local and global food systems with an emphasis on making 
                it accessible and better for all participants.
